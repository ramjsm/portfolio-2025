## üèóÔ∏è Static Site Generation (SSG)

This portfolio implements a custom SSG solution that pre-renders all pages at build time for optimal performance and SEO.

### Pre-rendered Routes

The following routes are automatically generated as static HTML:

- `/` - Home page
- `/about` - About page
- Project pages:
  - `/project/the-magic-box`
  - `/project/juliette`
  - `/project/synthara`
  - `/project/as-below-so-above`
  - `/project/invocation`
  - `/project/soberania-creativa`
  - `/project/irmajoanne`

### How SSG Works

1. **Client Build**: Creates the standard React bundle
2. **Server Build**: Creates a server-side rendering bundle
3. **Pre-rendering**: Each route is rendered to static HTML using the server bundle
4. **Hydration**: The client bundle takes over for interactivity

### Adding New Routes

To add new routes to SSG:

1. Add the route to your React Router configuration
2. Update the `routes` array in `scripts/ssg-build.js`
3. Run `pnpm build:ssg`

## üö¢ Deployment

### Static Hosting (Recommended)

Since this is a static site, you can deploy to any static hosting provider:

#### Netlify

```bash
# Build command
pnpm build:ssg

# Publish directory
dist/client
```

#### Vercel

```bash
# Build command
pnpm build:ssg

# Output directory
dist/client
```

#### GitHub Pages

1. Run `pnpm build:ssg`
2. Deploy the `dist/client` folder to your `gh-pages` branch

## üéØ Performance Benefits

With SSG enabled, your portfolio gets:

- **Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP)** - HTML is ready immediately
- **Better SEO** - Search engines can crawl pre-rendered content
- **Improved Lighthouse scores** - Static content loads faster
- **Better social media sharing** - Meta tags are pre-rendered
- **Reduced server load** - Static files can be served from CDN

## üîß Technical Details

### SSR-Safe Components

Components that use browser-specific APIs are wrapped with `SSRSafe` to prevent server-side rendering errors:

```tsx
import { SSRSafe } from './components/SSRSafe'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <SSRSafe fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <BrowserSpecificComponent />
    </SSRSafe>
  )
}
```

### GSAP Initialization

GSAP plugins are conditionally registered only on the client side:

```tsx
// Only register GSAP plugins on client-side
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, SplitText, ScrambleTextPlugin)
}
```
